# Equitive

Equitive is a targeted training platfrom for all employees, to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion best practices from hiring to onboarding and beyond.

Equitive focuses on customizing training for different stages of the hiring process. For example, if you write job descriptions you will be specifically trained on that aspect of the process. This is not a one-sized fits all training, but one thats meant to be relevant to each employee's involvement.
The traning modules are more fun and engaging with gamified content such as quizzes and a newsfeed so you can see how your peers are doing with their training. 
We provide a place to host all company wide standards for hiring, so every candidate is compared against the same metrics. 

This github project builds out a web application to prototype the idea. You can access the demo at https://equitive-demo.web.app/
